Debugging allows you to view the html structure of your creative, view and adjust CSS to tweak visual elements, as well as view network activity, console logging, and performance monitoring.<br /><br />When it comes to debugging a mobile site or ad, you don’t have easy access to an inspector tool like you do on a desktop. Fortunately Chrome, Safari and Firefox all offer remote debugging over a USB connection to your desktop.<br /><br />Check out the resources section for additional information and links from across the web.",
