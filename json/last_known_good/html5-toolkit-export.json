Always double check with your Publisher to be sure.</p><h3>What is a good baseline for HTML5 Creative file size?</h3><p>It’s essential to understand your Publisher’s ad serving specifications prior to building your Creative. However, many Publishers follow the IAB recommendation of 35KB (compressed) Initial Load for the Creative and 100KB for total Creative size. Initial Load refers only file size of the .html file in the Creative, not the Enabler, Javascript, CSS, or other image files, but again, check with your Publisher to understand their guidelines to be sure. </p><p>More info about the IAB’s recommendations can be found <a href=\"http://www.iab.net/guidelines/508676/508767/mobileguidelines\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (page 8/9 <a href=\"http://www.iab.net/media/file/HTML5DAv101.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) and DoubleClick’s recommendations <a href=\"https://support.google.com/richmedia/answer/165130?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><h3>How much does DoubleClick Enabler add in file weight?</h3><p>As of April 2015, the Enabler adds approximately ~75KB (~25KB when gZipped).</p>",

HTML5 is the language of the Web, but an App is the language of, well, the phone it’s on! So when you put a HTML5 creative inside an app it needs some ‘Magic’ to make them talk the same language. This ‘Magic’ is called <a href=\"http://www.iab.net/mraid\" target=\"blank\">MRAID</a>, but luckily for us the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/richmedia/answer/2672553?hl=en\" target=\"blank\">DoubleClick HTML5 Enabler</a> does all this for us.

For example:</p><pre>.container {<br>&nbsp;background: red;<br>}<br><br>@media (max-width: 768px) {<br>&nbsp;.container {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;background: blue;<br>&nbsp;}<br>}<br><br>@media (max-width: 480px){<br>&nbsp;.container {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;background: black;<br>&nbsp;}<br>}</pre><p>In the example above, if a browser is wider than 768px (most desktop browsers), the .container element will be red. If the browser is between 768px and 480px wide (most tablets oriented to portrait), the .container element will be blue. If the browser is 480px or smaller (most phones oriented to portrait), the .container will be black.</p><p>Media queries are particularly useful for making your full screen Creatives look great on all browser sizes. Another advantage for media queries is for when you have multiple sized Creatives, but only want to maintain one local CSS file.
