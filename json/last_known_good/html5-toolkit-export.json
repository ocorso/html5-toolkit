      "description" : "<p>The ability to make portions of your Creative transparent is useful for “takeover” style Creatives or when animating different elements within your Creative. There are three different ways to achieve this with CSS: overflow:hidden, clip-path, and masks. For a more thorough analysis of the clip-path vs. mask properties, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/clipping-masking-css/\" target=\"_blank\">read this article</a>.</p><h2>Overflow:hidden</h2><p>A traditional method of clipping an element is by nesting the element to be clipped within a div that has overflow:hidden applied to it. This method will work in all browsers, but is limited to the shapes you can make with a div/border radiuses. Here are a few <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/4bL12nz0/\" target=\"_blank\">code examples</a> that also showcase animating the mask.</p><h2>Clip-Path</h2><p>Clip Paths, similar to overflow:hidden, are best used for hard (vector) edges. Clip Paths are dependent on an SVG shape and offer greater flexible in terms of geometry. A basic example can be found <a href=\"http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZGXrKr\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <a href=\"http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/\" target=\"_blank\">Clippy</a> is an online visual tool for creating simple and complex clip-paths. Clip-paths are not compatible with any version of Internet Explorer.</p><h2>Masking</h2><p>The mask property is a way to achieve masking with the transparency or luminosity of a source image. More details about this property can be found <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/#toc-browser-support\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) are the only browsers that support image masking.</p><h2>Compatibility</h2> <p>For the latest specifics on browser compatibility, be sure to check caniuse.com for <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=clip-path\" target=\"_blank\">clip-paths</a> and <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=mask\" target=\"_blank\">masks</a>.
